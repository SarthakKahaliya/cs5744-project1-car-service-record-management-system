                    The general public, insurance firms, and automobile manufacturing businesses are going to be the
                    ones to utilize this system to keep track of car servicing information. First and foremost, everyone
                    who is interested in purchasing a pre-owned automobile wants to make sure that they are receiving a
                    good bargain on the vehicle. The insurance companies are the secondary users of this system. Then,
                    before determining the rate for the car insurance, the insurance company would verify the history of
                    the vehicle. Furthermore, the automobile manufacturing companies will manage the inventory for the
                    various vehicle components based on the vehicles' service records.

                    <li>Sarthak is a new doctoral student who wants to study math as his field of expertise. His home is
                        a studio apartment that is located three miles away from the university. Although the local
                        public transportation is pretty dependable where he moved to, getting around on the weekends,
                        when bus frequency is greatly reduced, can be a little bit of a challenge. Because of this, it
                        will be difficult to successfully plan all of the events around the bus schedule. But he does
                        have another strategy to avoid that consequence. On the other hand, he may anticipate that his
                        parents will come to see him during the winter holidays. In that case, he will want to be able
                        to drive them to a variety of tourist destinations, so having a car will be of some use to him
                        during that time. Given that he is pursuing a doctoral degree and that he is going to stay here
                        for a while, another purchase that makes sense for him to make is that of a car. He starts
                        looking for a new vehicle online and visits a number of different websites. When Sarthak
                        discovered a deal that appeared to be too good to be true—the seller was trying to sell him an
                        expensive car for a cheap price—he started to have some worries about the car's condition. The
                        seller was offering to sell him the car for a low price. When it comes to this topic, our
                        website can be of assistance. With the assistance of this, he will be able to establish whether
                        the auto parts are original or not, whether the maintenance was routine or not, the condition of
                        the car, and whether or not the automobile will require any prospective future servicing.

                    <li>Priyanshi is an analyst that works for a company that specializes in insurance. Every day, as
                        part of her job, she looks at the condition of a car to figure out how much the insurance
                        premium will be. To figure out how much insurance will cost, she has to think about more than
                        thirty things, like the car's make, model, and year, as well as its previous owners, any
                        accidents, any extra features, and any damage to the body. The problem is that she has to get
                        all of the information by hand from a number of different third-party vendors and repair shops.
                        Also, some data is missing from different places, and the format of the data varies from one
                        vendor to another. Now, what she needs is a system with a central database that lets her just
                        type in the license plate number of the car and see all the information from the database on the
                        screen.</li><br>

                    <li>Automakers can view the data and determine which parts require greater maintenance. Rahul, who
                        works for an auto parts manufacturer, wants to ensure that his business spends more time and
                        money producing auto parts that are in high demand than those that are not. He was looking for a
                        website that would assist him in making manufacturing decisions because his business was losing
                        money because they were producing more headlights than necessary and there were very few sales
                        of this component. So they could determine which parts of that specific automobile they needed
                        to build in large quantities by using an online tool that Rahul could log into, enter the car
                        model, and analyze.
