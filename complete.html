            <h3>Background</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    On average, over 6 million passenger car accidents occur in the United States each year, and in
                    the United States, there are around 239,100 auto repair and maintenance facilities. The data
                    shows us that consumers in the United States spent a total of 194.9 billion dollars on services
                    for their motor vehicles in 2021. This data is maintained by numerous third-party vendors and
                    insurance firms, which may result in inaccurate or fragmented data. Therefore, a central system
                    All the data that can be readily maintained is required. Our plan is to create a system that
                    keeps track of auto maintenance, which will be helpful when buying or selling a certain car to
                    learn more about it and its condition. This technology will assist in keeping track of data
                    regarding used or accident-damaged vehicles. The idea of this project originated when one of
                    our teammates had to solve this problem during an interview for a full-time software engineer
                    Role.
                    <br> <br>

                    We believe that the issues raised in the real-world scenario will be addressed by this project.
                    Additionally, we think that there aren't any trustworthy mechanisms in place for keeping track
                    of car maintenance records, which could affect both the price of a car overall and potential
                    Buyers.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Without the appropriate architecture, the system is a little too complex to handle, and as more
                    work proceeds, the complexity will only grow, making it more challenging to add new features,
                    make adjustments, and optimize the code. The system's performance, scalability, usability, and
                    manageability will all be directly impacted by the architecture, which will help define the
                    system's overall integrity. We also need our system to have module-to-module interaction, data
                    abstraction, and some additional functionality, and in order to do so, it is very important for us
                    to pick the right architectural style.

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p>
                    The general public, insurance firms, and automobile manufacturing businesses are going to be the
                    ones to utilize this system to keep track of car servicing information. First and foremost,
                    everyone
                    who is interested in purchasing a pre-owned automobile wants to make sure that they are
                    receiving a
                    good bargain on the vehicle. The insurance companies are the secondary users of this system.
                    Then,
                    before determining the rate for the car insurance, the insurance company would verify the
                    history of
                    the vehicle. Furthermore, the automobile manufacturing companies will manage the inventory for
                    the
                    various vehicle components based on the vehicles' service records.

                <ol>
                    <li>Sarthak is a new doctoral student who wants to study math as his field of expertise. His
                        home is
                        a studio apartment that is located three miles away from the university. Although the local
                        public transportation is pretty dependable where he moved to, getting around on the
                        weekends,
                        when bus frequency is greatly reduced, can be a little bit of a challenge. Because of this,
                        it
                        will be difficult to successfully plan all of the events around the bus schedule. But he
                        does
                        have another strategy to avoid that consequence. On the other hand, he may anticipate that
                        his
                        parents will come to see him during the winter holidays. In that case, he will want to be
                        able
                        to drive them to a variety of tourist destinations, so having a car will be of some use to
                        him
                        during that time. Given that he is pursuing a doctoral degree and that he is going to stay
                        here
                        for a while, another purchase that makes sense for him to make is that of a car. He starts
                        looking for a new vehicle online and visits a number of different websites. When Sarthak
                        discovered a deal that appeared to be too good to be true—the seller was trying to sell him
                        an
                        expensive car for a cheap price—he started to have some worries about the car's condition.
                        The
                        seller was offering to sell him the car for a low price. When it comes to this topic, our
                        website can be of assistance. With the assistance of this, he will be able to establish
                        whether
                        the auto parts are original or not, whether the maintenance was routine or not, the
                        condition of
                        the car, and whether or not the automobile will require any prospective future servicing.

                    <li>Priyanshi is an analyst that works for a company that specializes in insurance. Every day,
                        as
                        part of her job, she looks at the condition of a car to figure out how much the insurance
                        premium will be. To figure out how much insurance will cost, she has to think about more
                        than
                        thirty things, like the car's make, model, and year, as well as its previous owners, any
                        accidents, any extra features, and any damage to the body. The problem is that she has to
                        get
                        all of the information by hand from a number of different third-party vendors and repair
                        shops.
                        Also, some data is missing from different places, and the format of the data varies from one
                        vendor to another. Now, what she needs is a system with a central database that lets her
                        just
                        type in the license plate number of the car and see all the information from the database on
                        the
                        screen.</li><br>

                    <li>Automakers can view the data and determine which parts require greater maintenance. Rahul,
                        who
                        works for an auto parts manufacturer, wants to ensure that his business spends more time and
                        money producing auto parts that are in high demand than those that are not. He was looking
                        for a
                        website that would assist him in making manufacturing decisions because his business was
                        losing
                        money because they were producing more headlights than necessary and there were very few
                        sales
                        of this component. So they could determine which parts of that specific automobile they
                        needed
                        to build in large quantities by using an online tool that Rahul could log into, enter the
                        car
                        model, and analyze.

                <h5><u>System Architecture</u></h5>
                Based on the system's requirements, we identified five main components. The database, REST API
                (authentication module, DAO Module, and Request Handler Module), and The five core components are
                the
                five core components. Each of these components belongs to one of three tiers in a multi-tier design.
                The
                data tier is in charge of data storage and retrieval. The database module is included in this tier.
                All
                business logic, including permission and access control, is handled by the application tier. This
                tier
                is made up entirely of the REST API, which is made up of the Authentication module, the DAO module,
                and
                the Request Handler module. The presentation tier serves as the system's external interface. The web
                application is part of this tier. In the presentation tier, the web application talks to the REST
                API
                modules in the application tier, and the REST API talks to the database module in the data tier.

                    It is important for us to define modules in a way such that the application behaves in a cohesive
                    manner and performs all the functionalities. The basic workflow of this application is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Request Handler module: This module is responsible for handling the requests made by the client
                        and validating them by either giving an invalid request response or continuing processing the
                        requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Authentication module: This module is responsible for authenticating the clients. This will make
                        sure only certain users are given the permission to edit or update certain data on the website.
                        Whenever a user tries to log into the website, they will first be authenticated, and then they
                        will be logged in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DAO module: This module is responsible for connecting the database module through any request
                        that is made. This module contains all the queries that will fetch all the data from the
                        database. This is the only module that will connect to the database.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database: This module is responsible for providing all the functionalities of a database to the
                        website. When a user requests a service, the website will pull up data that is stored in our
                        database and display it to the user.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                            Databases are an important part of every web application because they provide the
                            application
                            with the ability to retrieve, store and handle all the data. There are several popular types
                            of
                            databases: relational, key-value, and document based with their own benefits and drawbacks.
                            Relational databases are used to store the structured data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary key for the majority of the entities defined in the data model will be a number.
                            This identifier will be produced automatically by the database and won't reveal any extra
                            information about the entity it represents. Using the IDs and a foreign key constraint,
                            certain
                            entities will relate to other entities. Additional restrictions will be set to enforce
                            unique
                            rules that will be defined for certain of the data stored in the system to ensure data
                            integrity. Lastly, effective data retrieval is required. We shall define the necessary data
                            indices for this.
                            We will choose Azure SQL database service to host databases due to its superior cost and
                            performance in comparison to other cloud providers.

                            Using the SPA approach has a number of benefits. The first is that, since only one page is
                            used
                            and is rewritten based on what the user does, the page does not need to be reloaded when
                            switching between pages. This keeps the user experience smooth and makes it work like a
                            normal
                            desktop app. Additionally, the web page only loads once, and any additional code (such as
                            HTML,
                            CSS, or JavaScript) is only loaded when the user interacts with the page or as needed. This
                            will
                            make page loads faster and reduce the overall load on the server, which will make the user
                            experience better and meet NFR-8.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            React, a JavaScript toolkit for making user interfaces (the "view layer"), will be used to
                            make
                            the application's front end. The program will be divided into a number of independent,
                            self-contained modules, which will speed up development and make it simple to reuse
                            components
                            across the entire application. React employs a virtual DOM, which makes loading multiple
                            views
                            quick and efficient. It also lets apps run smoothly on a variety of platforms and devices,
                            including mobile, which will also be a key part of our system. We will also use Redux
                            because it
                            will be hard to keep track of all the different states of our complex and large application.
                            Managing application state is easy with Redux, an open-source JavaScript toolkit that is
                            incredibly lightweight. This will help us to make sure that we are always providing the user
                            with accurate information and that the program is responding appropriately to user input.

                        For the backend we are using the REST API which will be crucial to the system's operation. It
                        will provide a common language for dealing with the data and house the majority of the system's
                        business logic.

                    <h6>DAO</h6>
                    DAOs help setting up the database connection and interacting with it by sending SQL CRUD
                    commands.They also communicate with the clients to provide and obtain data.

                    As we can see in the sequence diagram above, the car manufacturer client will interact with the
                    web application when it tries to request login. The request handler will handle the request
                    login information by authenticating the client and then validates the login by authenticating
                    it. The authenticating module will send the request to DAO module will check if the email or
                    password entered by the user is valid or not and then relates the status to request handler.
                    Now, the car manufacturer client can enter the model of the car they want an information about
                    and the request handler will send this request to REST API will send this request to DAO module.
                    After receiving data from the database, DAO creates a model object or a list of model objects.
                    Finally, DAO returns the model object(s) created to the client

                    information by authenticating the client and then validates the login by authenticating it. The
                    authenticating module will send the request to DAO module will check if the email or password
                    entered by the user is valid or not and then relates the status to request handler. Now, the
                    insurance company client wil want information about different cars in order to decide the car
                    insurance and for that they can enter the model of the car they want an information about and
                    the REST API will send this request to DAO module. After receiving data from the database, DAO
                    creates a model object or a list of model objects. Finally, DAO returns the model object(s)
                    created to the client.

            <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p>
                <h4>System Architecture Rationale</h4>
                We have explained or pointed to a good deal of the thinking that went into a good number of the design
                choices throughout the entirety of this material. At the highest possible level, our primary concerns
                are the following: the data that the system needs to manage and store; the business logic; and an
                interface to the system. There is a distinct pattern emerging here for a layered architectural design.
                When we use a layered or three-tier architecture, we can take advantage of the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It uses an architecture that has been proven to work for contemporary web apps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separate layers make subsequent expansion less difficult. (that is, a single REST API may be
                        utilized by
                        a number of different front-end applications).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separation of code makes both development and maintenance much simpler.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scalability can be controlled separately by components.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                </p>

                <p>
                <h4>Database Design Rationale</h4>
                <p>The relational database model is the one that we choose to use for the storage of the system&apos;s
                    structured data. The main things that led to this conclusion were the level of development that
                    relational databases reached and the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
                    properties of these databases. In the end, what this comes down to is making sure that the data that
                    is stored in the system is completely trustworthy.</p>
                <p>We chose Azure SQL database service as our database platform because it can both run in the cloud and
                    meet the need to standardize on a single platform. By using SQL standards, it may be possible to
                    build the database without being tied to a specific database management system.Azure SQL database
                    service platform is low-cost, scalable.</p>

                </p>
                <h4>Web Application Design Rationale</h4>
                <p>The tech stack that we will be using for this will be React, HTML, JS, Java, and MySQL. A few
                    significant advantages of developing the application as an Single Page Application (SPA) deliverable
                    are - CDN can be used to develop and deploy the application, which will speed up the loading of
                    HTML,
                    JS,
                    and other resources;
                    we may create the user interface with React in manageable, reusable modules.<br><br>
                    An alternative to our approach would be a more conventional web application such as using PHP, in
                    which requests are
                    made
                    to a server, the pages are created, and then the user is redirected to them. With such a strategy,
                    the loading of the Pages will be slower as we
                    would need to connect our frontend application with the REST API application and extra
                    resources will be required
                    to handle the entire stack. The SPA strategy best meets our needs due to these
                    factors.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Backend Design Rationale</h4>
                    <p>
                        The REST API is a critical component of our system. It decouples data storage from the user
                        interface. Due to the separation, it is easier to run our front end and back end on different
                        servers. This is not a requirement of our system, but the REST API gives us this freedom.
                        Meanwhile,
                        it allows other third-party apps to use our database's data for their own creations. Each
                        application will run alone, with no interference from the others. Furthermore, it makes no
                        difference what language the third-party developers are using.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They can use our service in the same way regardless of whether they have Python, Java, or PHP.
                        Also,
                        the separation will make it easier for different development teams to work on different parts of
                        the
                        system when we start making and putting it into action.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our REST API will be built using Java and the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern. It will
                        be
                        object-oriented and based on the design pattern. As explained in the high-level design section
                        (the
                        data access layer), DAO abstracts and wraps all data-related actions into a single layer. DAOs
                        are
                        the only objects that interact directly with the database. As a result, if the structure of our
                        database changes, it will only affect the methods implemented within the DAO classes.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The DAO design pattern follows "coding to the interface," which is one of the best ways to write
                        object-oriented code. The interface is the foundation of the DAO pattern. Other sections of the
                        REST API concentrate on what each DAO does rather than how it does it. Within DAO classes, the
                        implementation is free to alter as long as it provides the same functionality. This loosens the
                        coupling between each component and better prepares us for future adjustments. Another benefit
                        of using the DAO style is that the JUnit tests run faster. Because all data access is wrapped up
                        in DAO classes, test data, often known as "mock data," can be used. In essence, the main
                        benefits of the DAO pattern are the separation of roles and the loose connections between them.
                        Because user demands Because science and technology are constantly evolving, this feature will
                        make it easier for our system to accommodate changes.

                    The Car Service Record Management System is a system that is dedicated to users who want to get the
                    details of the car that they want to buy, insurance companies that want to decide the insurance
                    premium that they can charge, so they can decide that based on the data that they can get from the
                    report of the car. Workshop owners can get the details of the part that is related to the car so
                    they can fix that with ease as they have all the history of the car. Also, with the help of the
                    data, factory owners can decide which particular part is in demand so they can produce that more and
                    whichever part is in less demand, they can produce less. The system has 4 modules, i.e., the Request
                    handler module, Authentication module, DAO module, and database module, which will handle different
                    queries and output the appropriate results. The architecture that we followed for this project is
                    layered architecture. A layered architecture will give us flexibility, maintainability, and
                    scalability for the application and will provide easy reuse of the components. With the help of
                    layered architecture, it's easy to keep these logical levels and parts focused on different things.
